                <h3>Description:</h3>
                        <p>This project was for a course I am currently enrolled in, ENTR 390 (Digital Product Design). This was 
                            the second major project of the class. I came up with the idea for Chow after seeing a family member
                            struggle with newfound dietary restrictions and allergies. The product idea came naturally and felt
                            like the best and most simlpe solution. I sketched out my ideas and developed them into wireframes using in Figma. I 
                            designed the high-fidelity prototype in Figma which is linked to the image above.</p>
                        <p>
                            Chow was created to provide a space for users to track meals and symptoms related to those meals. 
                            Throughout the development process, the product has changed direction and narrowed down in scope. 
                            With these changes, the problem statement has shifted to the following: people who experience diagnosed 
                            or undiagnosed dietary restrictions or allergies need a place to track their meals and the corresponding 
                            symptoms to further understand any relationships so that they can create the best diet for themselves. 
                            The product interprets any relationships between certain foods and the symptoms tracked for that day or 
                            the related meal time. The value behind Chow is that it learns about the user within the first few uses 
                            until the product’s algorithm understands the user’s eating habits and symptom frequencies. Using this information, 
                            Chow creates charts displayed on the homescreen so the user can get a summarized and interpretable view of their 
                            symptoms for the current week.  As the user interacts with Chow more, the data will become increasingly accurate. 
                        </p>
                        <p> The product is intended for all people who have allergies or dietary restrictions (by choice or not) and those who 
                            are unsure whether or not an issue they are facing is diet related. While I believe there is a high value for those 
                            who are newer to their allergies/sensitivities or unsure if they have allergies/sensitivities, I am interested to 
                            learn more about how someone who has lived with allergies for many years would view the product. I believe that the 
                            market should not focus too much on people who have lived with their allergies or dietary restrictions for many years 
                            since they likely have their diet under control. They are still considered a part of the market, but they are not a 
                            focus given the likelihood that they would not need a product like Chow. This area of the market is an opportunity for 
                            improvement and with more user testing and interviewing of this subset of the audience, I believe that Chow can be adapted 
                            to become useful for people who have lived with dietary restrictions for many years.
                        </p>
                        <p> While identifying the target market, I identified several key use cases and scenarios for users on Chow. The most 
                            important use case is for someone new to allergies/dietary restrictions looking for a tool to help guide them through
                            their transition to a new diet that minimizes their adverse symptoms. This use case ties into the following scenario: 
                            a new user going through the onboarding process. After viewing the problem statement and intended use of the app, this 
                            user will create an account and navigate to the homescreen for a brief tour. Another use case I identified was someone 
                            who is unsure what is causing them symptoms and want to see if they can find any relationships. They use Chow as a tool to 
                            find what foods are causing them difficulties. They commit to adding all of their meals and any symptoms they are experiencing 
                            into the application. The scenarios they encounter are the Add a Meal scenario and Add a Symptom scenario. They follow similar 
                            steps through both inputting the details for both and logging their date and time. While these are just a few use cases and 
                            scenarios, the use cases directly relate to the personas I’ve identified which are detailed below.

                <h3>Persona Profiles:</h3>
                <p>The primary persona for Chow is someone recently diagnosed with food allergies or dietary restrictions who is unsure of how to 
                    keep their symptoms under control and wants to create a diet that makes them feel better. The primary persona I created for Chow was Anna. 
                    Anna is 23 years old and recently graduated from college. After several years of feeling unwell after many meals she visited a doctor who 
                    diagnosed her as sensitive to gluten, dairy, and recommended trying a Low FODMAP or SIBO diet. He recommends that Anna avoids gluten and dairy 
                    entirely but they are ingrained in her diet. She is still learning what meals do not contain gluten and dairy and wants to try either SIBO or 
                    Low FODMAP. She wants a tool to help her adjust to her new sensitivities. Chow benefits Anna because she can try either diet for a few weeks at 
                    a time and track her symptoms to see which reduces her symptoms most. She can track it all in one place and make her transition towards a new 
                    diet easier with the data about how certain foods affect her.
                    <br><br>
                    The secondary persona for Chow is someone who is undiagnosed, believes their diet is causing their recurring symptom(s), and wants to determine 
                    what is the root cause. The secondary persona I created for Chow is Liam. Liam is 17 years old, a junior in high school, and frequently experiences 
                    nausea, bloating, and indigestion. Liam eats nearly all foods. He learned that experiencing nausea, bloating, and indigestion to his frequency is abnormal. 
                    He decides to learn on his own what is causing these issues. Liam finds Chow which allows him to track all of the foods he eats in a day and track his 
                    symptoms alongside the varying foods. While doing this, he starts reading the charts that Chow is creating for him and begins trying an elimination diet. 
                    He eliminates the foods he sees frequently appear on days of particular trouble. He notices improvements after three weeks of cutting out all nuts. Next 
                    he is going to try cutting out soy.

                <h3>Sketches:</h3>
                <p>I began this project by sketching out ideas for the interface. My main focus was creating a platform
                    that was simple and direct to the point with all of the necessary functions. Since the user is likely 
                    using this to collect information about what foods cause them the most difficulty, I made sure to put the 
                    to most useful functions on the homepage along with a chart of the past week's data. These sketches show 
                    the early ideas I then adapted into wireframes.
